Welcome to MarkWiki
===================

> MarkWiki is a wiki that uses Markdown to create pages. Markdown has a simple
text based approach to define content which you can [learn very quickly] [syn].

Why Should I Use MarkWiki?
--------------------------

The aim of MarkWiki is to have a dead simple set of features and be easy to set
up. MarkWiki was born out of frustration with bad documentation tools behind a
company firewall.

You should consider MarkWiki if you:

* Need something working fast.
* Are looking for a no fuss answer to how to collaborate with teammates.

Getting Started
---------------

If you've made it this far, then you've probably figured out how to run
MarkWiki. Congratulations! Now you may want to consider a bit more
configuration so you don't have to restart MarkWiki manually every time your
server reboots. Check out [[MarkWiki/Deployment]].

You might, however, be reading this from some other website. MarkWiki
requires a couple of steps to get going. Fire up the command line and follow
along!

1. Install it.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the built-in web server.

    $ python markwiki.py
