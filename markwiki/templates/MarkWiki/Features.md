MarkWiki Features
=================

MarkWiki stays very true to the [original Markdown specification] [syn] with
some minor deviations. It also has other cool features that make working
with Markdown even better!

[TOC]

### Wiki Links

Normal Markdown syntax does not include wiki links, but MarkWiki does. Text
between open and closing double square brackets will be treated as a wiki link.
`[[AnAwesomeWikiPage]]` is an example of a valid wiki link.

Wiki links can include letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, spaces, and
forward slashes.

If you ever need to use a literal \[\[ for some reason, you can use a backslash
(\\) immediately before each square bracket. This will prevent MarkWiki
from turning it into a wiki link.

### Wiki Sections

A forward slash in a wiki link is used to group pages. MarkWiki takes advantage
of this categorization itself by putting all its help pages under the
`MarkWiki` category. This documentation generally refers to these categories as
"Sections." Sections can exist within other sections and can be as deep as
desired, but it is recommended that you [[Please/Do/Not/Torture/Others]].

### Table Of Contents

You can add a table of contents anywhere in the wiki page by putting `[TOC]` on
a line by itself. This page has an example if you look at the Markdown source.

### Code Highlighting

MarkWiki supports code blocks in traditional Markdown style (i.e. by using
identation). MarkWiki also supports a code block style similar to
[GitHub] [git]. You can create a code block by using triple backticks (\`\`\`)
at the beginning of a line and closing the block with more triple backticks.

    ```
    <Your code here>
    ```

This technique can also be used to highlight code if you provide the language
after the first set of backticks. Check the source of this help page and look
at the example below.

```python
class Foo(object):
    '''This is a Python documentation string.'''

    def __init__(self, bar):
        self.bar = bar

```
