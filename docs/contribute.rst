Guidelines
----------

1. Your code should follow PEP 8 style. Please run it through ``pep8`` to
   check.
2. Please try to conform with any other conventions seen in the code for
   consistency (e.g., using ``'''`` for docstrings instead of ``"""``).
3. Make sure your change works against master! (Bonus points for unit tests.)
