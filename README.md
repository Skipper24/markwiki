MarkWiki
========

*A simple wiki using Markdown*

Running MarkWiki
----------------

From the project's root directory, run:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python markwiki.py

Design Goal
-----------

MarkWiki should be as simple as possible to set up. A basic working
configuration should never need more than two steps.

1.  Install the dependencies.
2.  Start the web server.

Why? MarkWiki is aimed at teams that want a no fuss, no frills wiki. Simplicity
trumps features.

Dependencies
------------

All the dependencies for MarkWiki are stored in `requirements.txt`.
